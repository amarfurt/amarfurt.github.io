Hi! I'm a lecturer at <a href='https://www.hslu.ch/en'>HSLU</a> since September 2022, in the areas of natural language processing and MLOps. I hold a PhD from <a href='https://www.epfl.ch/en/'>EPFL</a> for my thesis on <a href='https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/302951?ln=en'>Interpretable Representation Learning and Evaluation for Abstractive Summarization</a>. Previously, I received a BSc and MSc in computer science from <a href='https://ethz.ch/en.html'>ETH Zurich</a> and worked as the first employee in startups to create a health data platform and analyze user data.
