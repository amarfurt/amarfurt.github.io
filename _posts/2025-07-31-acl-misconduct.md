We presented our paper [Analyzing the Evolution of Scientific Misconduct Based on the Language of Retracted Papers](https://aclanthology.org/2025.sdp-1.6/) at the Scholarly Document Processing workshop at ACL 2025. This paper came out of a group collaboration among all NLP PhD students in our research group, nice teamwork spearheaded by Christof Bless!
